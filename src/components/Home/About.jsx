                  I am a full-stack developer, I jumped into the field of programming at the start of
                  2022, where I have since created personal
                  projects and collaborated with others through Mission Ready
                  HQ.

                  At the end of September, 2022. I went on to join Revived Design as an Intern Software Developer, where I learnt a new language (flutter) and got to hone my skills in testing and DevOps, even though there were challenges to begin with, I am glad to say that I overcame a lot of the obstacles by working closely with my mentor and through researching on possible solutions.

                  In the middle of 2022, I went on to join Mission Ready HQ
                  after I began self-teaching myself to code at the start of the
                  year. I enjoyed the journey as I got to experience working
                  with other developers and UX designers and learn new
                  frameworks and tools.

                  During the process of running our business, I experienced a
                  little bit of Liquid and Jquery in managing our shopify
                  website and a lot of software which was involved in acquiring
                  stock which was very interesting to me, this ultimately lead
                  me in to pursuing software development.
