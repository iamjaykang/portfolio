                I am a Full Stack Developer that has been involved in the
                sneaker business which I co-founded for all of my professional
                career, I jumped in to the field of progamming at the start of
                2022 to change up my career pathway and challenge myself. Since
                the start of 2022, I found myself creating my own projects and
                collaborating with others which I found to enjoy.

                During the process of running our business, I experienced a
                little bit of Liquid and Jquery in managing our shopify website
                and a lot of software which was involved in acquiring stock
                which was very interesting to me, which ultimately lead me in to
                pursuing the software development pathway.

                In the middle of 2022, I went on to join Mission Ready HQ after
                I began self-teaching myself to code at the start of the year. I
                enjoyed the journey as I got to experience working with other
                developers and UX designers and learn new frameworks and tools.
